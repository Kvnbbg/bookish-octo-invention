## üêõ Reporting Bugs
Help us squash bugs by following these steps:

1. **Search First**: Check [existing issues](link-to-issues) to avoid duplicates
2. **Create Issue**:
   - Use our bug report template
   - Include key details:
     - Environment (OS, browser, version)
     - Reproduction steps
     - Expected vs. actual behavior
     - Screenshots/GIFs (if helpful)

**Good Bug Report Example**:
```markdown
**Environment**: Windows 10, Chrome 102.0.5005.63

**Description**: 
Login fails with valid credentials when 2FA is enabled.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Enable 2FA in account settings
2. Attempt to login with correct credentials
3. Observe "Invalid credentials" error

**Expected**: Successful login with 2FA prompt
**Actual**: Immediate "Invalid credentials" error
```

## üöÄ Feature Requests
We welcome ideas to improve the project!

### Before Submitting:
- Check if the feature was previously discussed

### How to Submit:
1. Open a new issue with the "Feature Request" label
