# ADR-001: Adopt Senior Developer Modernization Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The Bookish Octo Invention platform has grown into a multi-faceted Spring Boot application with Dockerized deployment, security features, and Oracle/H2 database support. Current delivery lacks automated governance for CI/CD, security scanning, probabilistic analytics, and architectural documentation.

## Decision
Adopt the Senior Developer Modernization Framework as the guiding standard for platform evolution. This includes:
- Comprehensive CI/CD via GitHub Actions with testing, SAST, container scanning, and staged deployments.
- Layered security practices encompassing supply chain protection, secrets management with HashiCorp Vault, and threat modeling.
- Integration of probabilistic algorithms to enhance analytics, personalization, and anomaly detection capabilities.
- Governance through ADRs, DORA metric tracking, and living documentation updates.

## Consequences
- Requires initial investment to implement pipelines, observability stack, and security tooling.
- Establishes clear ownership (CODEOWNERS) and review processes that may slow ad-hoc changes but improve reliability.
- Enables data-driven decisions via DORA metrics and observability insights.
- Creates an extensible framework for future ADRs documenting architecture and modernization milestones.
